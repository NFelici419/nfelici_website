            Welcome to my About Me. I am 20 years old from Indianapolis IN, studying to become a certified Informatics Security professional.
            As an Informatics Security major, I have studied and worked with programming languages such as C and Python while also having experience using Linux. 
            In this field, I am interested in knowing more about the things that happen in the background and how C plays a role in protecting and breaching systems. 
            Eventually, I hope to make a career in cybersecurity, helping organizations protect their data and systems from cyber threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also a professional photographer.
            I have around 5 years of experience and I love capturing 
            moments and telling stories through my lens. I picked this hobby, now profession,
            because I enjoy meeting new people and creating art.
            Photography allows me to express my creativity and connect with people in a unique way.
            Whether it's doing portraits, events or weddings, 
            I enjoy the challenge of capturing the essence of a moment and creating lasting memories for my clients.

        I first started my photography journey in the beginning of covid, starting off with my phone. 
        Eventually after two years of practice and working my part&dash;time job, I saved enough money to buy my first beginner camera.

        </figure> 

    <div class="body-text">
        As I got more experience and kept practicing with my camera, 
        I decided to eventually take photos for my school.
        I first started with soccer photos since I was already part of the team and got some good photos
        that ended up making it into the yearbook and being framed as gifts for the senior players. <br>
        Once basketball season started, I took more photos for the team and got even better at capturing action shots.
        Below are a few shots from the soccer and basketball seasons.

        After high school, I decided to take my photography to the next level and get into doing portraits of friends and family,
        with some events on the side. Now that I am in college and have a good amount of experience,
        I have been able to build a small photography business doing portraits and weddings.
        Below are shots from my most recent photoshoots.
